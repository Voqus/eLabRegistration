# eLabRegistration
An application built in Java using SQLite as database.

# Depedencies:
- rs2xml.jar          (exist in src/lib folder)
- sqlitejdbc-v056.jar (exists in src/lib folder)

# What you need:
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) version 8+ since it involves lamda expressions
- [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) (if you want to clone and run)
- As for database, I used SQLiteDatabase addon from [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) for the DDL part.
